## Course Description
Students will learn to efficiently find structures and patterns in large data sets. Topics will include acquiring data sets and cleaning messy and noisy raw data sets into structured and abstract forms; applying scalable and probabilistic algorithms to these well-structured abstract data sets; and, formally modeling and analyzing the error inherent in these methods. Students will consider data representations and trade-offs between accuracy and scalability.

This course will include a survey of data acquisition and cleaning tools; similarity search, clustering, regression/dimensionality reduction, graph analysis, PageRank, and small space summaries; and, recent developments and the application of these topics to modern applications, often relating to large internet-based companies.

__Our class will meet Tuesdays and Thursdays, 8:00 am - 9:20 am in the Science Building (GRSC), Room 223.__

## Prerequisites
This course is for students who have successfully completed Math 3080 and either Math 2270 or Math 2250 with a C or better in each course.

## Textbook
In this class, we will focus most of our attention on the following two books:
* Leskovec, Jure et al., [*Mining of Massive Datasets*](http://www.mmds.org/), 3rd Edition, 2020.
* Brunton, Steven L. and J. Nathan Kutz, [*Data-Driven Science and Engineering*](http://databookuw.com/databook.pdf), 2019.
  * Companion website: [http://databookuw.com](http://databookuw.com).

Both books are free digitally at the links given above. If you choose, you can purchase these books for reasonable prices on Amazon or other textbook websites.

Additional material and datasets needed for the course will be available on the course GitHub page:

## Required Materials
* Access to a computer (desktop, laptop, or computer lab)

## Grading Policy
| Assignment	      | Percentage of Grade |
| :---              | :---:               |
| Homework	        | 35%                 |
| Computer Projects | 25%                 |
| Midterm Exam      | 20%                 |
| Final Exam	      | 20%                 |

__Homework__ will be assigned using Canvas. Each assignment will consist of questions from the textbooks, or questions relevant to the textbook sections. You can complete and submit the questions either on paper (after which you will scan using the "Canvas Student" app) or electronically. Assignments will be graded within a week after the due date.

__Class Projects__ will be assigned throughout the semester. These will be opportunities for you to apply what you are learning in lecture and in the homework in a more realistic scenario.

The __Midterm Exam__ will be administered around week 8 or 9 of the semester and will cover material covered from the beginning of the semester up until that point. __The Final Exam__ will be a comprehensive exam covering material from the entire semester. The date of the final exam is indicated on the semester schedule. Details for the exams will be given in class as the time approaches.

>A request to take a final exam at any time other time than when it is officially scheduled must be initiated with the professor and approved by the Dean or Department Chair at least two weeks before the scheduled final exam. A charge of $50.00 per exam will be assessed if the request is approved.

### Late Policy
All __homework assignments and class projects__ will be accepted for 70% credit for one week after the due date. Assignments submitted one week after the due date or later will not be accepted.

>I understand that emergencies happen. As such I will wave the late penalty for up to 3 late homework assignments. Otherwise, late homework submissions need to be discussed with me prior to the due date to avoid the late penalty.

All __exams__ must be taken in the allotted time. If you cannot take the exam in the requested time, then you must *coordinate with me __no later than one week before the exam is due__*.

### Grading Scheme
| Grade	| Percentages |   | Grade | Percentages |
| :---  | :---:       |---| :---  | :---:       |
| A	    | 93% - 100%  |   | C	    | 73% - 76%   |
| A-  	| 90% - 92%   |   | C-    | 70% - 72%   |
| B+    | 87% - 89%   |   | D     | 63% - 66%   |
| B     | 83% - 86%   |   | D-    | 60% - 62%   |
| B-    | 80% - 82%   |   | D+    | 67% - 69%   |
| C+    | 77% - 79%   |   | F     | 0 – 59%     |

A grade of “I” (incomplete) cannot be issued unless arrangements have been made with your instructor before the last day of class. In addition, don’t expect the college to give you a “W” (withdrawal) if you disappear from school. They won’t do it. Instead, you will get a grade of “F” for the course. No exceptions. So if you must leave, please drop the course officially through the admissions and records office.

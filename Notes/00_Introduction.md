There are 4 major terms that are often used interchangeably in data science.

| Area             | Description |
| :--------------- | :---------- |
| Big Data         | Working with datasets that are so large that they defy traditional analysis methods |
| Data Mining      | Process of searching and analyzing data to discover previously unknown patterns |
| Machine Learning | Subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it has learned, without being explicitly programmed |
| Deep Learning    | Specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making |
| Data Science | Process and method for extracting knowledge and insights from large volumes of disparate data |
| Artificial Intelligence | 


* Big Data
    * Increase in computing power and storage capability allows us to handle more data in a shorter amount of time
    * Allows us to get more insights than we were able to get before
    * Velocity, Volume, Variety, Veracity, Value
        * Velocity: Speed at which data accumulates
        * Volume: Scale of the data (amount of data stored)
        * Variety: Diversity of the data (structured, unstructured) and diversity of data sources
        * Veracity: Origin and Quality of data and its conformity to facts and accuracy
        * Value: Ability to turn data into something that will benefit society
* Data mining
    * Involves preprocessing it and transforming it into an appropriate format
    * Tools include
        * Data visualization
        * Machine learning
        * Statistical models
* Machine Learning
    * Learn from examples and do not follow rules-based algorithms
* Deep Learning
    * Built off of neural system of the human brain
* Data Science
    * Broad term that encompasses everything
    * Utilizes statistical analysis, data visualization, and more
    * Utilizes big data, machine learning, and deep learning (among others) to mine information from data
* Artificial intelligence
    * Uses Data Science to program computers to learn how to solve problems and make intelligent decisions


## Data Mining Process
1. Set Goals
2. Select Data
3. Preprocessing (Data Cleaning)
4. Transform data (Data Wrangling)
5. Mine the Data (Analysis and Modeling/Machine Learning)
6. Evaluate the Data and share results

    "## What is Data Mining?\n",
    "* Data mining is the process of getting info from data. Really, all three semesters can be summarized as Data Mining\n",
    "  * Originally known as \"Data Dredging\", it was the process of trying to extract information that isn't always supported by the data. Not the most glamorous part of a statistician's job\n",
    "  * Later it focused more as \"Big Data\", which is gleaning information from large amounts of data\n",
    "  * Now known as \"Data Mining\", we now extract this information for the purpose of creating a model (which gets into adaptive modelling, or \"Machine Learning\")\n",
    "* This semester, we focus on Big Data: handling and managing large amounts of data\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we get information from large amounts of data?\n",
    "* Statistical Modeling (Linear regression, Normal distributions) <- 3080\n",
    "* Machine Learning (models such as Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks) <- 3480\n",
    "* Summarization (Google's PageRank) <- 3280\n",

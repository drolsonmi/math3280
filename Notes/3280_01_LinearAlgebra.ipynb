    "* Data mining is the process of getting info from data. Really, all three semesters can be summarized as Data Mining\n",
    "  * Originally known as \"Data Dredging\", it was the process of trying to extract information that isn't always supported by the data. Not the most glamorous part of a statistician's job\n",
    "  * Later it focused more as \"Big Data\", which is gleaning information from large amounts of data\n",
    "  * Now known as \"Data Mining\", we now extract this information for the purpose of creating a model (which gets into adaptive modelling, or \"Machine Learning\")\n",

    "#### Vector Norms (Measuring Distance)\n",
    "A norm is a way to calculate the length of a vector. Another way to say it is to measure the distance from the tail to the tip. But how do we measure the distance?\n",

    "\n",

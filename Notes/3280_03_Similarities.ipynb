    "* Some characters are more likely to occur than others (*a* is more common than *z*)\n",
    "  * Good rule of thumb is to approximate with only 20 possible characters, so the number of $k$-shingles is __$20^k$__\n",
    "\n",
    "For an email, $k=5$ is pretty good. For a large document (such as a research paper), we may want to increase that to $k=9$.\n",

    "Here is a couple things to look at to analyze this graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Looking at this data, we see that a pair of columns has at least a 50% chance of becomming a candidate pair when the Jaccard similarity is a little over 0.4 or higher.\n",
    "    * The probability jumps from 0.18 to 0.80 (a difference of over 0.6) when $s$ increases from 0.3 to 0.5. That means that the slope where the probability is 50% ($s$ is just over 0.4) is roughly $0.6/0.2 = 3$.\n",
    "    * This shows a pretty clear distinction between the two sides of the graph\n",
    "    * If two columns are not similar, then there is little chance that bands will agree, so little chance it will become a candidate pair\n",
    "    * If two columns are actually similar, then there is a high chance that bands will agree, so high chance it will become a candidate pair\n",
    "\n",
    "2. At $s=0.7$, we calculate the chance of one band not agreeing to be $1-0.7^4 = 0.7599$ (That is, a 75.99% chance of at least one disagreement in a band, or only a 24.01% chance that all agree). However, if we look at all 25 rows, then there is a $(1-0.7^4)^{25} = 0.0010$ (or $0.1%$) chance that all bands disagree (that is, of the 25 bands, the one you look at has a 99.9% chance that the signatures agree).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, LSH actually does significantly increase the odds of finding columns with high Jaccard similarity."

For example, the utility matrix matches each user with a movie (the item) with a user rating. The item profile is a matrix that matches each movie (the item) with information such as actors or average ratings.

For example, there is a section on each Amazon page labelled, \"Customers who bought this item also bought.\" Instead of creating an Item Profile, we just use that item's column in the utility matrix, and instead of using a User Profile, we just use that user's row in the utility matrix.

    "### Duality of Similarity\n",
    "A utility matrix can both relate items to users and relate users to items. However, they are not always symmetric relationships. Two examples of how symmetry is broken:\n",
    "1. Even though we can find the similarity between different items, we need to take an additional step in order to make recommendations to users.\n",
    "    * One method may require more calculations than the other\n",
    "    * For example, we need to normalize each user's ratings to estimate true ratings in cases where users tend to always give either high or low ratings\n",
    "2. A user's behavior and an item's features may not always be compatible. \n",
    "    * For example, a piece of music must be only one genre, whereas users can like multiple genres\n",
    "    * If you have two people who both like 80's music, that doesn't necessarily mean they have the same tastes. One might like 80's music and classical music, while another might like 80's music and jazz. So, using one user's preferences to make recommendations to another may not always work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The duality of the utility matrix can be seen in the following scenarios:\n",
    "1. We can compare one user A's row to find $n$ other users most similar to A, then take average ratings of each item I to predict whether user A will like I or not\n",
    "2. We can compare one item I's column to find $m$ other items most similar to I, then take the average rating of all these similar items given by user A to predict whether user A will like I or not\n",
    "\n",
    "For either method, we need to fill in (predict) values for most items in a user's row in order to make predictions. Which method we use (using similar users or similar items to predict the value) doesn't matter so much. However, there are tradeoffs:\n",
    "* Using similar users, we only have to do the process once to get enough information to fill in the row for user A\n",
    "* Using similar items, we can get more reliable information, but at the expense of doing more calculations\n",

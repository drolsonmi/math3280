    "The book one of *Game of Thrones* has 187 different characters. Assume I have never read this book, and that I want to know the most important character of the book. I could do this by simply finding which character is mentioned the most in the book. But just because they are mentioned a lot doesn't necessarily mean they are the most important.\n",

    "So, let's try to identify the most important character using PageRank. The following dataset looks at the number of characters mentioned in the book (\"Source\") and any characters mentioned within 15 words (\"Target\") after the Source character is mentioned, and the number of times this link occurs (\"weight\").\n",
